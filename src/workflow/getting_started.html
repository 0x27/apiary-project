<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>The Apiary workflow you are now using helps streamline the process of extracting valuable text and data from herbarium specimens. In this workflow, you can help in this process in three main stages: specimen analysis, text transcription, and text parsing. Throughout the workflow, you can find more detailed help topics within each stage - this brief overview will help you better understand the context and purpose of each stage. Once you read this Getting Started overview, you can start to explore the Apiary Workflow by using the Apiary Help feature - a button labeled with "?" located in the top right of the workflow screen.</p>

<h2>Specimen Analysis</h2>
<p>In this stage, you look at the specimen image and use your mouse and cursor to draw boxes around areas of the image that contain text information then you classify each area according to the type of information in that area. These areas are called Regions of Interest or ROIs. These are then further analyzed in the next stage - text transcription.</p>

<h2>Text Transcription</h2>
<p>In this stage, you look at an image of a specimen ROI (region of interest) from the previous stage and transcribe the text on the ROI by typing in the text as you see it on the image. In some cases you might be able to get transcription help through a built-in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process that uses a computer application to automatically read the words and characters in the image. OCR isn't as accurate as you are, so even when OCR is able to transcribe some of the text, you can help finish this stage by proof-reading the OCR results. The transcribed text in this stage is then ready for parsing in the next stage.</p>

<h2>Text Parsing</h2>
<p>The transcribed text of an ROI from the previous stage is parsed into separate parts in this stage. By separating the text into standardized components, you help format the text data into a globally standard format that allows all the information from the specimens be shared and analyzed with other biodiversity projects around the world.</p>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>
<p>After the specimen has passed through each of these stages, the data go through a final process to ensure accuracy and data quality then the data you help extract will be shared with the rest of the world to help better understand our world's biodiversity.</p>
