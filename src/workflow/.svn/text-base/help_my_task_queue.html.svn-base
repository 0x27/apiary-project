<h1>My Task Queue Help</h1>
The My Queue area displays a list of the items you are currently working on and lets you add more items to your queue. The My Queue area is displayed in a "drawer" that you open by moving your mouse over the "My Queue" tab near the bottom left of the screen (or anywhere along the left edge of the screen). The drawer will automatically slide out and show you a list of the items you are currently working on.

At the top of the My Queue drawer is a link that lets you add more items to your queue. The items in your queue can be both specimens and regions of specimens. They are listed in your queue in a heirarchy with each specimen being listed with the regions from that specimen listed below it. You can expand and collapse the region list by clicking on the triangle at the right side of the specimen item.

<h2>Specimens</h2>
Each specimen is displayed as two lines in your list. In the top line is the specimen name and its current status. In the second line is the number of regions currently defined in the specimen and a link to analyze the specimen. When you click the "analyze" link, you will see the specimen image displayed along with tools that let you define new regions. If the specimen already has regions defined, you will see them as boxes drawn on the specimen image and a list of all the regions of the specimen are displayed to the right of the  image.

<h2>Regions</h2>
When a specimen has regions defined for it, they are displayed in My Queue below the specimen. Each region is displayed with three lines of text. The first line includes the region name as well as a link you can select if you wish to remove the region from your queue when do not wish to work on that region. The next line displays a link to transcribe the region along with the current status of the transcription for that region. The last line displays a link to parse the region along with the current status of the text parse process for that region.
