<h1>Parse Controls Help</h1>
<p>
There are two methods for parsing the transcribed text for a region - copy and paste by right clicking and classifiying in a contextual menu. In both cases, the options for parsing will depend on the type of region that you are parsing. If the options don't seem appropriate for the region, then it is possible that the region was classified incorrectly.
</p>

<h3>Contextual Menu</h3>
<p>
Select the text you wish to parse then right click on the selected area. This will display a contextual menu with a heirarchical choice of options. Select the appropriate choice and it will be added to the correct field to the right.
</p>

<h3>Copy and Paste</h3>
<p>
Select the text you wish to parse then copy it. On the right of your browser window, expand the category of options and find the appropriate field. Click in the field and paste the text.
