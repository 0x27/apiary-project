<h1>Workflow Interface Overview</h1>
<p>The Apiary workflow interface gives you access to various tools to analyze herbarium specimen images and extract text and data from them. The interface is arranged into four main areas: Workflow Navigation, My Queue, Specimen Workbench, Workflow Tools. WIthin the workflow, each of these areas have an Apiary Help feature that allows you to further explore the details of the interface and learn how to use the tools at each stage. The help feature is available by clicking on the "?" button within each area you wish to explore more.</p>

<h2>Workflow Navigation</h2>
<p>The workflow navigation area at the top of the screen gives you access to each of the stages in the workflow in which you will analyze the specimen images and extract information from them. Typically you will see three workflow stages, but there may be less based on the particular workflow you are working in and permissions granted to you. The typical workflow stages are Analyze Specimen, Transcribe Text, and Parse Text. You navigate to each stage by clicking on the button in the workflow navigation bar. Within each interface area there are further help menus that explain the details of the interface for that stage.</p>

<h2>My Queue</h2>
<p>The My Queue area displays a list of the items you are currently working on and lets you add more items to your queue. The My Queue area is displayed in a "drawer" that you open by moving your mouse over the "My Queue" tab near the bottom left of the screen (or anywhere along the left edge of the screen). The drawer will automatically slide out and show you a list of the items you are currently working on.</p>

<h2>Specimen Workbench</h2>
<p>The specimen workbench is where you do most of your work at each stage. The interface changes depending upon the stage you are currently working in, but in general the left area of the screen is used to display the specimen image or the area of the specimen image you are working on while the right area contains the information you are extracting from the specimen.</p>
